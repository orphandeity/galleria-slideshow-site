### What I learned

This project presented some unexpected challenges, mostly having to do with the masonry layout. I managed to create a javascript solution that sorts the data into columns and then styled with a comination of flex-box and grid. This gave me a much better understanding and appreciation of how "Pinterest" style layouts are made.
